### Exciting Things! Flows Finance receives a grant from the Raiden Trust

<!--truncate-->

It's with great excitement the team behind Flows Finance formerly [ouropayments](https://ouropayments.com) announces receiving a grant from the [Raiden Trust](https://www.raidentrust.li/).

:::note

The _Raiden Trust_ is an independant entity to the Raiden network founded in April 2019 to facilitate support for projects and research that are building the Raiden Network ecosystem.

:::

The team at [Avo Labs GmbH](https://avolabs.io) took part in the Gitcoin Protect Privacy hackathon where they brainstormed ouropayments a privacy preserving payment stream service. Inspired by [Sablier](https://sablier.finance) and the concept of real-time finance but detered by the high gas costs and lack of privacy the team built ouropayments a truly private payment stream built on the Raiden Network.

After winning at the hackathon with the Flows Finance proof of concept the team went through a rigorous review process with the Raiden Trustees where we received a grant to build the project further.

The project has since been rebranded to Flows Finance to better capture the notion of real-time finance and the underlying concept of continuous payment streams.

The team is working hard to take the proof of concept into a battle tested, robust, user friendly application.

Flows Finance is under active development and coming to you soon! Watch this space for progress updates and be sure to follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/financeflows) or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/kcJ63expb8) to stay in the loop
